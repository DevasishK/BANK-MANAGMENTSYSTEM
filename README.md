# BANK-MANAGMENTSYSTEM
Simple Banking System in C - README
Overview
This C code provides a simplified implementation of a banking system, allowing users to perform basic banking operations. The program is run through a command-line interface and offers features like account creation, login, transactions, and loan applications.

Features
New Customer Account Creation: Users can create new accounts by entering their personal information, including name, age, account number, password, mobile number, and initial deposit amount.

Customer Login: Existing customers can log in using their registered name and password to access their account details.

Transactions: Logged-in users can perform transactions such as withdrawals and deposits from their accounts, considering account balances and transaction limits.

Loan Applications: Customers can apply for different types of loans, including home loans, agriculture loans, personal loans, and gold loans. The loan approval process involves assessing the user's credit score.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to run the program:

Compile the code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).

Copy code
gcc banking_system.c -o banking_system
Run the compiled executable.

bash
Copy code
./banking_system
The program will display a menu of options. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the different functionalities.

Code Organization
The code is structured into several functions, each responsible for a specific aspect of the banking system:

main(): The entry point of the program. It presents the initial menu options for user registration or login.

new_customer(): Handles the process of creating a new customer account. It collects user input for account details and stores them in the "input.txt" file.

customer_login(): Manages the login process for existing customers. It reads account information from the "input.txt" file and verifies the user's credentials.

menu2(): Presents the main menu for logged-in users. Users can choose between transaction operations, loan applications, or other options.

account_transaction(): Provides options for users to perform transactions, including withdrawals and deposits.

account_withdrawal() and account_deposit(): Handle withdrawal and deposit operations, considering account balance and transaction limits.

Loan-related functions, including account_loan(), homeloan(), agricultureloan(), personalloan(), and goldloan(): Manage the loan application process, credit score assessment, and loan calculations.

Important Notes
The code can be enhanced in various ways, such as implementing better input validation, error handling, and improving code structure.

Some functions used, like getch() and system("cls"), may not work consistently across different operating systems.
